                        Technical Documentation & Functionality Report
Overview:
        The City Health Dashboard represents a core functionality of the Sustainable Smart City Assistant, 
designed to provide real-time monitoring and visualization of critical urban environmental and infrastructure metrics for Kakinada city. 
This web-based dashboard serves as a centralized platform for city administrators, environmental officials, and citizens to track key 
sustainability indicators.

Purpose and Objectives:
        The dashboard addresses the growing need for transparent, data-driven urban management by providing 
comprehensive visibility into four critical areas of city health: 
air quality, water consumption, electricity usage, and waste generation. By consolidating 
these metrics into a single interface, the system enables informed decision-making for sustainable 
urban planning and resource management.

Core Functionality
1)Real-Time Monitoring Capabilities:
The dashboard continuously tracks and displays current-day values for four essential city health 
indicators through prominently featured Key Performance Indicator (KPI) cards. These metrics provide 
immediate situational awareness of the city's environmental status and resource consumption patterns.
2)Historical Trend Analysis:
A sophisticated interactive visualization system presents seven-day historical trends for all monitored 
parameters. The multi-line chart employs color-coded series to distinguish between different metrics, 
enabling users to identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies across various city systems simultaneously.


Monitored Parameters:
1)Air Quality Index (AQI)
Tracks atmospheric quality conditions with values ranging from 50-150 in the current simulation, 
providing critical information for public health advisories and environmental policy decisions.
2)Water Usage Monitoring
Measures daily municipal water consumption in liters (range: 100,000-200,000L), 
enabling water resource management, conservation planning, and infrastructure capacity assessment.
3)Electricity Consumption Tracking
Monitors daily power usage in kilowatt-hours (range: 5,000-10,000 kWh), supporting energy efficiency 
initiatives, grid management, and renewable energy integration planning.
4)Waste Generation Analysis
Quantifies daily solid waste production in tons (range: 20-50 tons), facilitating waste management 
optimization, recycling program effectiveness, and environmental impact assessment.
